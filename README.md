## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I work at an indie-studio [Khamitovs Team](https://github.com/KhamitovsTeam). My focus area for the past few years has been game development with the FNA Framework, but I'm also skilled in Unity 3D with C#.

Iâ€™m **currently working** on [CHIP: Rescuer of Kittens](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029830/CHIP_Rescuer_of_Kittens/)

**Portfolio:** https://zazaraisovna.ru/games

**Talks:**
- Gamedev podcast host [**Khamitovs Cast**](https://podcast.khamitovs.team/) (ru)
- Guest on podcast [**KDI Cast**](https://youtu.be/hBHWjgHkn0w) (ru)
