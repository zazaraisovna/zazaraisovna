## Hi there 👋

I work at an indie-studio [Khamitovs Team](https://github.com/KhamitovsTeam). 

I’ve been creating games for several years, mostly using **FNA Framework** and **Unity (C#)**. 

Currently working on [CHIP: Rescuer of Kittens](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1029830/CHIP_Rescuer_of_Kittens/) - a retro metroidvania about saving kittens 🐱

Also building a custom engine — **KTEngine**.

## ✨ Fun fact

I love narrative design, pixel art, and a bit of magic in games.  
Outside of dev, you’ll find me playing drums 🥁 or cycling through forests 🚲
